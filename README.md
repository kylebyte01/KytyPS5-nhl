> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a test build, tested on one PC. Expect fps drops and the odd crash. It's a fork of
> [duy64/KytyPS5-nhl](https://github.com/duy64/KytyPS5-nhl) and holds **no game files**: you need your own dump of the game.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🛠 **Be a Pro crash fixed.** Opening Weekly Growth or Traits crashed the game every time. 5 of 5 opens crashed before the fix, 0 of 13 after it.
- 🖼 **Be a Pro pictures fixed.** The hub headline picture and the player, agent, coach and GM portraits no longer come out as coloured noise.
- 🎯 **Steady pace.** Menus hold 30 fps and play holds 60 fps, the way the game asks for them, instead of running uncapped.
- ⚡ **A faster build.** Built with PGO and AVX2. Play 1% lows rose from about 46 to about 49 fps, and frames over 50 ms in a match fell from about 30 to about 15.
- 🖱 **One double-click to start.** `Play-NHL27.cmd` applies all the NHL 27 settings for you and remembers your game folder.
- 📦 **Everything in one zip.** No separate emulator or launcher to install.

## 🚀 Get started

1. Download `KytyPS5-nhl27-enhanced-rc3.zip` (11 MB) from the release page.
2. Extract it anywhere you can write to, with at least 2 GB free. Not inside `Program Files`.
3. Double-click `Play-NHL27.cmd`.
4. Pick your game folder, the one that holds `eboot.bin`. It's remembered in `game_path.txt`: delete that file to pick another folder.
5. Keep the black window open while you play. Close the game window when you're done.

Don't start `kyty_emulator.exe` directly: it would run without the NHL 27 settings.

To keep saves from another Kyty install, copy `_SaveData`, `_DownloadData` and `_Trophies` into this folder.

**First start:** shaders compile while you play, so the first arena load stutters for 30 s or longer. That happens once per folder. New modes can hitch the first time too. If your profile shows "Sign in required", press OK.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| System | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| Game | Your own dump of NHL 27 (PPSA34063). Tested with version 01.003.001 |
| CPU | AVX2 required (Intel Haswell / AMD Zen or newer). Without it the game won't start |
| Memory | About 14 GB of free RAM |
| GPU | About 10 GB of video memory at 2560x1440, with a current driver |
| Runtime | The latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), if a window names `MSVCP140.dll` or `VCRUNTIME140.dll` |

Tested only on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, an RTX 5080 with driver 621.01 and 32 GB of RAM. Expect lower numbers on slower hardware. Other GPUs have not been tried.

## 🐞 Known issues

- **Sudden fps drops.** Roughly 1 match in 4 in scripted tests drops to 5-10 fps, for a few seconds up to more than a minute. There are at least two causes and neither is fixed.
- **Crash when simming between shifts.** A tester on NVIDIA reports a crash in Be a Pro when 2 or more goals are scored during a sim to the next shift, on an earlier build. It could not be reproduced here: 5 sims ran clean, but none had 2 or more goals, so it may still be there.
- **Rare crashes.** One GPU device loss happened in a test build during this work, cause unknown.
- **Long sessions.** The longest test was 55 minutes. Three matches in a row, saving and reloading a career, and a full Be a Pro season have not been tested.
- **Stutter.** Entering play can stall for 70-220 ms, and heavy 30 fps cut-scenes can dip to 20-25 fps for a few seconds.
- **Starting again right after closing** can fail with `could not reserve 13824 MB for guest direct memory`. Wait a few seconds and try again.
- **ONES mode** needs readback on, according to upstream: add `--readback-linear-images true` to `extra_args` in `cfgGlobal.json`. Not tested with this build.
- **Online modes**, PSN and EA servers don't work, and that's not a goal of this project.
- The upstream bugs (jersey cloth, some skin tones, facial hair, bright pixels, logos) are unchanged.

**Hit a problem?** Open an [issue](https://github.com/MatusRiedl/KytyPS5-nhl27-enhanced/issues) or ask on [Discord](https://gg.puckpeak.com). Tell us the scene, your GPU and your driver version. After a crash or freeze keep `play_log.txt`: the next start moves it to `play_log_previous.txt`, and the start after that replaces it.

<details>
<summary><b>Settings and controls</b></summary>

### Display

Open `cfgGlobal.json` in a text editor.
| Setting | Values |
|---|---|
| `screen_resolution` | `R1280X720`, `R1920X1080`, `R2560X1440` (default), `R3840X2160` |
| `fullscreen_enabled` | `true` or `false` (default) |

Fullscreen ran fine at 2560x1440 in one short session. Other resolutions are untested.

### Controls

Plug in a controller before you start. On the keyboard:

| Keys | PS5 button |
|---|---|
| J / L / I / K | Cross / Circle / Triangle / Square |
| Arrow keys | D-pad |
| WASD | Left stick |
| Enter | Options |
| Q / E | L1 / R1 |

### Disk space

The folder grows to about 1 GB after the first run. The shader cache in `_PipelineCache` takes 100-150 MB, and `_TempData` is the game's own scratch data, about 850 MB. Copy `_PipelineCache` along if you move to a new folder, or the shaders compile again.

## What changed

Changes made on top of [duy64/KytyPS5-nhl](https://github.com/duy64/KytyPS5-nhl) release `a917829`, up to 2026-11-02:

- **Be a Pro crash:** a depth target reused at the same address with a wider width kept the old, narrower image. It's rebuilt now. This was not an NVIDIA driver bug.
- **Be a Pro images:** the game reads those pictures from memory right after the GPU draws them, and the emulator now copies them back in time. `KYTY_READBACK_STILLS=0` turns this off.
- **Pacing:** the game's own flip rate at a 60 Hz vblank is the default. `KYTY_FORCE_FLIP_RATE=0` with `KYTY_MENU_VBLANK_HZ=240` / `KYTY_PLAY_VBLANK_HZ=240` brings back the old behaviour.
- **Late flips:** at the 30 Hz flip rate, a frame that misses its vblank shows on the next vblank (50 ms) instead of the next even one (66 ms). `KYTY_LATE_FLIP=0` restores the old behaviour.
- **Build:** PGO and AVX2, with clang-cl 19.1.5 from VS 2022 Build Tools. Build line: [tools/pgo/README.md](tools/pgo/README.md).
- **Logging:** `NHL27FRAMETIME` every 5 s, `NHL27HITCH` for each frame from 40 ms.
- **Scripted input:** text and overlay keys, used for automated tests.
- **Start script and settings:** [tools/nhl27](tools/nhl27).

<summary><b>Measured</b></summary>

## Measured

Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080, scripted 15-minute CPU vs CPU Play Now match.

| | a917829 defaults (1 run) | Pacing fix (2 runs) | Pacing fix + PGO/AVX2 (3 runs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Play fps (median / p10) | 67 / 54 (uncapped) | 60 / 59-60 | 60 / 60 |
| Play mean 1% low (fps) | - | 44.9-46.9 | 48.7-49.8 |
| Play 5 s windows with no missed frame | - | 58-71% | 75-87% |
| Play frames over 50 ms (15 min) | - | 28-31 | 9-23 |
| Menus / 30 Hz scenes fps (median / p10) | 40 / - (uncapped) | 30 / 29 | 30 / 28 |

These numbers are from RC2. The RC3 fixes were not measured separately. On the RC3 code, a 55-minute Be a Pro run (two games) had no crash, with play at a median of 60 fps and a 1% low of 52.

AnyPS5 (boykopovar) was used as a reference only. No code was copied from it. The credits from upstream are in [docs/README-upstream.md](docs/README-upstream.md#credits).

The changes, measurements and notes were produced with an AI coding assistant (Claude) driving the build, scripted test runs and log analysis. The Be a Pro crash and the image bug were found by hand.
